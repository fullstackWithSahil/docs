## What is title
The title of your blog post is its main headline. It's the first thing readers see on your website, in search engine results (like Google), and when the post is shared on social media. Think of it as the hook that grabs your audience's attention and tells them what your article is about.

## Why title is important
A great title is crucial for a few reasons:

- It attracts readers. A compelling title makes people want to click and read your post. It should be clear, interesting, and relevant to what your audience is searching for.

- It helps with search engines. Search engines use your title to understand the topic of your blog post. Using important keywords in your title can help your content show up higher in search results, bringing more visitors to your website.

- It helps your post get shared. A good title makes your content more shareable. When people share your post, the title is what will appear, so you want it to be informative and engaging.

## What is a slug
A slug is the part of your blog post's web address (URL) that comes after your website's domain name. It's a short, human-readable identifier for your post. For example, if your blog post's full address is yourwebsite.com/blog/what-is-a-slug, the slug is what-is-a-slug.

Our system automatically creates a slug for you based on your title, so you usually don't have to worry about this step!

## Why is slug important
The slug is an often-overlooked but important part of your blog post's URL:

- **It makes the link easy to read.** A clean and simple slug makes your link look professional and trustworthy. This is especially helpful when someone copies and pastes your link.

- **It's good for SEO**. Like your title, a good slug helps search engines understand what your page is about. Using a few keywords in your slug can give your post a small boost in search rankings.

- **It's memorable.** A clear slug is easier for people to remember if they want to revisit your content later.
