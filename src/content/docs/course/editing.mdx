## Adding new modules and lessons
Adding new modules and lessons to an existing course is similar to how you add a module or a lesson to a new course.

### Creating Modules

Modules are the main sections of your course. They can be used to organize your content by topic, week, or any other logical grouping.

1.  After creating your course, you'll be taken to the course structure page.

4.  Repeat these steps to add as many modules as you need. You can always come back and add more later.

### Adding Lessons

Lessons are the individual components of your course, such as video lectures, assignments, or quizzes. Lessons are nested within modules.

1.  To add a lesson, first click on the module you want to add it to.
2.  In the lesson builder section, fill in the following details:
    * **Name:** Give your lesson a title (e.g., "Introduction to SEO").
    * **Description:** This section is similar to the description of a youtube video. You can provide a summary of the lesson's content or provide links to external links that might want to share.
    * **Lesson Number:** The builder automatically assigns a lesson number, but you can change this if needed to adjust the order.
    * **Upload Thumbnail:** Upload an image to serve as a thumbnail for the lesson. All the major image formats are supported and you do not have to worry about optimizing it for the web we will convert it to webp and resize it for you.
    * **Upload Video:** Upload your video content for the lesson. Only MP4 format is supported. You can either drag and drop your video file or click to select it from your computer.
