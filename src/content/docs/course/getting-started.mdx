Welcome to your course builder! Our platform makes it easy to create, structure, and publish your online courses. This guide will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your course to adding modules and lessons.

## Getting Started: Create a New Course
The first step to building your online course is to create it. You'll set the foundation by defining the course name, description, and other key details.

### Steps to Create Your Course

2.  A pop-up window will appear, prompting you to fill in the course details. Enter the following information:
    * **Course Name:** Give your course a clear and compelling title.
    * **Description:** Write a brief overview of what your course is about. This will be visible to your students and helps them understand the value.
    * **Price:** Set the price for your course.
    * **Thumbnail:** Upload a high-quality thumbnail image. This is the main image that will represent your course on your course page.

## Structuring Your Course: Adding Modules and Lessons

A well-structured course is easier for students to follow. Our builder uses a simple two-tier hierarchy: **Modules** contain **Lessons**.

### Creating Modules

Modules are the main sections of your course. They can be used to organize your content by topic, week, or any other logical grouping.

1.  After creating your course, you'll be taken to the course structure page.
    ![course builder](https://assets.buisnesstools.in/course-builder.png)

2.  In the **Enter module name** field, type the title for your first module.
3.  Click the **Add Module** button to create it.
    ![add module](https://assets.buisnesstools.in/add-module.png)
4.  Repeat these steps to add as many modules as you need. You can always come back and add more later.

### Adding Lessons

Lessons are the individual components of your course, such as video lectures, assignments, or quizzes. Lessons are nested within modules.

1.  To add a lesson, first click on the module you want to add it to.
2.  In the lesson builder section, fill in the following details:
    * **Name:** Give your lesson a title (e.g., "Introduction to SEO").
    * **Description:** This section is similar to the description of a youtube video. You can provide a summary of the lesson's content or provide links to external links that might want to share.
    * **Lesson Number:** The builder automatically assigns a lesson number, but you can change this if needed to adjust the order.
    * **Upload Thumbnail:** Upload an image to serve as a thumbnail for the lesson. All the major image formats are supported and you do not have to worry about optimizing it for the web we will convert it to webp and resize it for you.
    * **Upload Video:** Upload your video content for the lesson. Only MP4 format is supported. You can either drag and drop your video file or click to select it from your computer.
    <Aside type="caution">
        Currently we only support .mp4 files and we have a file size limit of 3 GB. If you want to uplode videos larger that 3 GB contact support.
    </Aside>

3.  Once the video and thumbnail have uploaded, click the **Add Lesson** button.

### Managing Modules and Lessons

* **Reorder:** You can easily reorder lessons by changing the lesson number manually.
* **Edit:** To edit a module or lesson, simply click on its name to expand and change the details.
